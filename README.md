# Maths Gaming Quiz
This is yet a another college project I had to complete. This conists of a maths game written in Java, it is a simple quiz where you must answer 10 questions depending on the diffculty. Yes there is multiple diffculties for this depending on the challnage, easy giving the most basic math questions, normal still giving basic questions but is slightly harder with a timelimit and hard giving all types of basic math questions such as addition, subtraction multiplication and divison, all written in Java for Android.

..and yes, we had to use Java which is a programing language I've never used in my life.

This game was created using `Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.1 Patch 2 ` which was the IDE I had use to use for this assignment. 

You can either build the application yourself and make your own modifications, or try it out with the pre-compiled version in the releases tab.
Since Iâ€™m not a programmer, I received assistance from ChatGPT for the code (which was allowed for the assignment).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

_Also keep in mind, since this a college project, it isn't maintained. I have only created this game for the assignment I had to complete and so since that is completed, there is no reason to commit and develop more changes here._
