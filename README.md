# Maths Gaming Quiz
Yes this is a another project I had to make in college, this time being a maths based game quiz where you needed to answer questions depending on the difficulty. The app has to be written in Java for devives
so that it can be used on mobile deveices. Basically we had to create a mobile app for Android devices.

This app was created using `Android Studio Meerkat | 2024.3.1 Patch 2` and the SDK is `Android API 22` which was the IDE and API level I had to use for the assignment. 

You can either build the app yourself and make your own modifications, or try it out with the pre-compiled version in the releases tab.
Since Iâ€™m not a programmer and had **NEVER** used Java in my life, I received assistance from ChatGPT for the code (which was allowed for the assignment).

## What does this assignment require?
The assignment I was provided required me to include the following features:

- A fully functional Android application 
- 3 difficulties (or as I call them, modes)
- A timer in two of the modes
- Basic mathmatical questions for a young audience (four years old and older)
- Sound effects depending if you got the correct answer or not
- Score system
- In a quiz based style
  
Once again this is a very simple concept on how the application must be written and created. Basic math isn't too complicated anyways but when it comes to learning Java, well that's a different story. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

_Also keep in mind, since this a college project, it isn't maintained. I have only created this game for the assignment I had to complete and so since that is completed, there is no reason to commit and develop more changes here._
